    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/molli/OneDrive/Documentos/UGA/Spring 2024/MADA/erickmollinedo-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

To do this I used the select() function. And then I explored the structure and summary of both new objects using str() and summary() to check if the objects were correctly created.\n\n#Creating new objects, using the 'select()' function to choose only the variables I need from the original dataset\nafricachild &lt;- africadata %&gt;% select(c(infant_mortality, life_expectancy))\nafricapop &lt;- africadata %&gt;% select(c(population, life_expectancy))\n\n#Using 'str()' to check the structure of the new objects\nstr(africachild)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\nstr(africapop)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ population     : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ life_expectancy: num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\n#Using 'summary()' to check the summary of the new objects\nsummary(africachild)\n\n infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :226                     \n\nsummary(africapop)\n\n   population        life_expectancy\n Min.   :    41538   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median :  5570982   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :182201962   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :51                         \n\n\nNow, I created a graph that illustrates life expectancy as a function of child mortality using ggplot(), with the africachild object.\n\n#Plotting life expenctancy as a function of infant mortality, using the 'ggplot()' package, in this case I used a point geometry using 'geom_point()'\nggplot(data= africachild, aes(x= infant_mortality, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is observed that there is a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nAnd here, I created a graph that shows life expectancy as a function of population using ggplot(), with the africapop object.\n\n#I used the 'geom_point()' geometry to plot the data points and set the x-axis to log scale using 'scale_x_log10()'.\nggplot(data= africapop ,aes(x= population, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_log10()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a positive correlation between life expectancy and population size, however there can be observed some weird ‘streaks’. If looking at the original dataset, this includes the population size from 1960 to 2016, so there are actually many years of observations instead of just one.\nI noticed there are years with missing data (NAs). To figure out which years have missing data I used the is.na() function in combination with filter().\n\n#Use `filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) to filter all observation that have missing values (NAs). Then I used 'count(year)', to summarize which years have the selected missing data.\nafricadata %&gt;% filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) %&gt;% count(year)\n\n   year  n\n1  1960 10\n2  1961 17\n3  1962 16\n4  1963 16\n5  1964 15\n6  1965 14\n7  1966 13\n8  1967 11\n9  1968 11\n10 1969  7\n11 1970  5\n12 1971  6\n13 1972  6\n14 1973  6\n15 1974  5\n16 1975  5\n17 1976  3\n18 1977  3\n19 1978  2\n20 1979  2\n21 1980  1\n22 1981  1\n23 2016 51\n\n\nThere is missing info on infant mortality from the years 1960 to 1981 and 2016. So it was best to choose a specific year for the analysis. Here, I created a new object africa2000 with only data from the year 2000. Then I checked the new data frame using str() and summary()\n\n#Create the object 'africa2000' using the 'filter()' function on the variable 'year' to select only the observations from the year 2000.\nafrica2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;% filter(year == 2000)\n\n#Check the new object using 'str()' and 'summary()'\nstr(africa2000)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africa2000)\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0  \n\n\nAnd here I made a new plot for life expectancy as a function of infant mortality for the year 2000 only.\n\nggplot(data= africa2000 ,aes(x= infant_mortality, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd another plot of life expectancy as a function of population for the year 2000 only.\n\nggplot(data= africa2000 ,aes(x= population, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is observed a negative association between infant mortality and life expectancy, however, the association between life expectancy and population is not clear. To do additional modeling, I tried to fit a linear model using the lm() function on the africa2000 dataset. I used life expectancy as the outcome and infant mortality as a predictor in the fit1 model, and life_expectancy also as outcome and population as the predictor in the fit2 model.\n\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa2000)\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = africa2000)\n\nAnd finally I used the summary() function to look at the fit results for both models.\n\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

It seems that life expectancy decreases as infant mortality increases. However, it appears there is no association between life expectancy and population size, according to the fit2 model, given p= 0.616, so there could be a different model that explains this association."
