    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/16786/MADA-Spring2024/erickmollinedo-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

To do this I used the select() function. And then I explored the structure and summary of both new objects using str() and summary() to check if the objects were correctly created.\n#Creating new objects, using the 'select()' function to choose only the variables I need from the original dataset\nafricachild &lt;- africadata %&gt;% select(c(infant_mortality, life_expectancy))\nafricapop &lt;- africadata %&gt;% select(c(population, life_expectancy))\n\n#Using 'str()' to check the structure of the new objects\nstr(africachild)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\nstr(africapop)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ population     : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ life_expectancy: num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\n#Using 'summary()' to check the summary of the new objects\nsummary(africachild)\n\n infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :226                     \n\nsummary(africapop)\n\n   population        life_expectancy\n Min.   :    41538   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median :  5570982   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :182201962   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :51\nNow, I created a graph that illustrates life expectancy as a function of child mortality using ggplot(), with the africachild object.\n#Plotting life expenctancy as a function of infant mortality, using the 'ggplot()' package, in this case I used a point geometry using 'geom_point()'\nggplot(data= africachild, aes(x= infant_mortality, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\nIt is observed that there is a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nAnd here, I created a graph that shows life expectancy as a function of population using ggplot(), with the africapop object.\n#I used the 'geom_point()' geometry to plot the data points and set the x-axis to log scale using 'scale_x_log10()'.\nggplot(data= africapop ,aes(x= population, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_log10()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\nThere is a positive correlation between life expectancy and population size, however there can be observed some weird ‘streaks’. If looking at the original dataset, this includes the population size from 1960 to 2016, so there are actually many years of observations instead of just one.\nI noticed there are years with missing data (NAs). To figure out which years have missing data I used the is.na() function in combination with filter().\n#Use `filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) to filter all observation that have missing values (NAs). Then I used 'count(year)', to summarize which years have the selected missing data.\nafricadata %&gt;% filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) %&gt;% count(year)\n\n   year  n\n1  1960 10\n2  1961 17\n3  1962 16\n4  1963 16\n5  1964 15\n6  1965 14\n7  1966 13\n8  1967 11\n9  1968 11\n10 1969  7\n11 1970  5\n12 1971  6\n13 1972  6\n14 1973  6\n15 1974  5\n16 1975  5\n17 1976  3\n18 1977  3\n19 1978  2\n20 1979  2\n21 1980  1\n22 1981  1\n23 2016 51\nThere is missing info on infant mortality from the years 1960 to 1981 and 2016. So it was best to choose a specific year for the analysis. Here, I created a new object africa2000 with only data from the year 2000. Then I checked the new data frame using str() and summary()\n#Create the object 'africa2000' using the 'filter()' function on the variable 'year' to select only the observations from the year 2000.\nafrica2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;% filter(year == 2000)\n\n#Check the new object using 'str()' and 'summary()'\nstr(africa2000)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africa2000)\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0\nAnd here I made a new plot for life expectancy as a function of infant mortality for the year 2000 only.\nggplot(data= africa2000 ,aes(x= infant_mortality, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()\nAnd another plot of life expectancy as a function of population for the year 2000 only.\nggplot(data= africa2000 ,aes(x= population, y= life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_log10()\nIt is observed a negative association between infant mortality and life expectancy, however, the association between life expectancy and population is not clear. To do additional modeling, I tried to fit a linear model using the lm() function on the africa2000 dataset. I used life expectancy as the outcome and infant mortality as a predictor in the fit1 model, and life_expectancy also as outcome and population as the predictor in the fit2 model.\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa2000)\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = africa2000)\nAnd finally I used the summary() function to look at the fit results for both models.\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

It seems that life expectancy decreases as infant mortality increases. However, it appears there is no association between life expectancy and population size, according to the fit2 model, given p= 0.616, so there could be a different model that explains this association."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/16786/MADA-Spring2024/erickmollinedo-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this readme file. Ideally of course in both locations.\nDepending on your specific project, you might want to have further folders/sub-folders."

For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

After processing, the disease_count object was created to represent the columns of count and disease. No further filtering was performed on that object. Another object, Weeks_Count, is used to represent count and weeks_reporting. In addition to the select() function used to select the two columns, the filter() function was used to remove any rows that had weeks_reporting= 0, as that suggest no reporting was done for those selected data points. After that was excluded, 288 observations were left in the Weeks_Count object.\n\n#An object is created that includes only data from the state of Georgia using the pipe operator and the filter() function.\nGeorgia_data &lt;-\n  us_contagious_diseases %&gt;%\n  filter(state == 'Georgia')\n\n#The str() and summary() function is used to verify that the object was made correctly\nstr(Georgia_data)\n\n'data.frame':   315 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ disease        : Factor w/ 7 levels \"Hepatitis A\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ state          : Factor w/ 51 levels \"Alabama\",\"Alaska\",..: 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 ...\n $ year           : num  1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 ...\n $ weeks_reporting: num  47 51 50 48 51 50 47 50 48 48 ...\n $ count          : num  509 922 990 750 763 ...\n $ population     : num  4306523 4373252 4442463 4514462 4589575 ...\n\nsummary(Georgia_data)\n\n        disease          state          year      weeks_reporting\n Hepatitis A:46   Georgia   :315   Min.   :1928   Min.   : 0.00  \n Measles    :75   Alabama   :  0   1st Qu.:1950   1st Qu.:33.00  \n Mumps      :35   Alaska    :  0   Median :1975   Median :45.00  \n Pertussis  :56   Arizona   :  0   Mean   :1971   Mean   :37.66  \n Polio      :41   Arkansas  :  0   3rd Qu.:1990   3rd Qu.:49.00  \n Rubella    :37   California:  0   Max.   :2011   Max.   :52.00  \n Smallpox   :25   (Other)   :  0                                 \n     count           population     \n Min.   :    0.0   Min.   :2901933  \n 1st Qu.:    8.5   1st Qu.:3444578  \n Median :   42.0   Median :5009127  \n Mean   :  643.0   Mean   :5235135  \n 3rd Qu.:  352.0   3rd Qu.:6478216  \n Max.   :22965.0   Max.   :9830160  \n                                    \n\n#Another object is created with 'weeks_reporting' and 'count'.

When fully plotted with a line of best fit, visually, there appears to be a positive correlation between the number of reported case and the number of weeks that the counts were reported, which makes logical sense. The total number of cases reported will increase when the time that is used to collect the reported response increase.\n\n#Using the package ggplot2 (which is found in tidyverse) to create a scatter plot using the variables in the object 'Weeks_Count' and assigning it to the variable 'p1\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(Weeks_Count, aes(x = weeks_reporting, y = log(count))) +geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n      ggtitle('Number of Weeks Reporting vs the Number of Reported Case')+\n      theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5))+\n      xlab('Number of Weeks Reporting')+\n      ylab('Total Number of Reported Cases (log-scaled)')+\n      labs(caption = \"Figure 1: The total number of reported cases plotted as a function of the number of weeks reported in the state of Georgia\")+\n      theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, face=\"bold\"))\n\n#The theme() function was a great way to manipulate the specific element in the plot, whether it was color, size, or orientation of the text or visuals.\n\n#Using the plot() function to determine if the plot was properly created\nplot(p1)\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to P1, I initially plotted disease_count as a bar graph to visualize the number of reported cases per disease type. This is shown in p2. Upon initial observation of the graph, it is clear that compared to the other disease listed, Measles easily acted as an outlier in the data set with the greatest number of reported case by far. This is followed by Pertussis and Hepatitis A.\n\n#Repeating the previous two steps to plot 'disease_count' in 'p2'\np2 &lt;- ggplot(disease_count, aes(x = disease, y = count)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", fill = \"skyblue\")+\n      ggtitle('The Type of Disease vs The Number of Reported Case')+\n      theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5))+\n      xlab('Disease Type')+\n      ylab('Total Number of Reported Cases')+\n      labs(caption = \"Figure 2: The total number of reported cases plotted as a function of the disease type reported in the state of Georgia\")+\n      theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, face=\"bold\"))\n\n#print the plot\nplot(p2)\n\n\n\n\nAs I was unable to discern any valuable information for the disease Smallpox or Rubella due to the scaling, I replotted the graph as a violin plot overlayed with plot points to better visualize the spread of the data over the different disease while accounting for the outlier that caused the scaling issue. I plotted this as p2_2.The violin plot showed the data distribution and the density of each variable. The individual data points overlaps it for more visual clarity.\n\n#When looking at the previous plot, there is a distinct outlier for the Measles category, thus making it difficult to determine the value that's provided from the other disease. To combat that, another plot was created to improve the clarity of the visualization of the same data set.\np2_2 &lt;- ggplot(disease_count, aes(x = disease, y = log(count))) + \n      geom_violin(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n      geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7) + \n      ggtitle('The Type of Disease vs The Number of Reported Case')+\n      theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5))+\n      xlab('Disease Type')+\n      ylab('Total Number of Reported Cases (log-scaled)')+\n      labs(caption = \"Figure 3: The total number of reported cases plotted as a function of the disease type reported in the state of Georgia\")+\n      theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, face=\"bold\"))\n\n#print the plot\nplot(p2_2)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional plot for fun\nLooking at Figure 4, one can see that aside from Polio all of the other diseases listed show a upward positive trend. This suggests that Polio have little change case reported despite the time elapse, which aligns with historical and public vaccination efforts. Looking at Measles, it showed the greatest positive slope, showing the greatest growth in number of case over some set of time, which corroborates what is shown in Figure 2.\n\n#Replotting p1 with clearly assigned data point to disease variable. Compared to p1, I added color and a legend to the points to distinguish which data point represent which disease type. \np4 &lt;- ggplot(Georgia_data, aes(x = weeks_reporting, y = log(count), color = disease, label = disease)) +geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n      ggtitle('Number of Weeks Reporting vs the Number of Reported Case')+\n      theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5))+\n      xlab('Number of Weeks Reporting')+\n      ylab('Total Number of Reported Cases (log-scaled)')+\n      labs(caption = \"Figure 4: The total number of reported cases plotted as a function of the number of weeks reported in the state of Georgia\")+\n      theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, face=\"bold\"))+\n      labs(color = \"Disease Type\")\n\n#The theme() function was a great way to manipulate the specific element in the plot, whether it was color, size, or orientation of the text or visuals.\n\n#Using the plot() function to determine if the plot was properly created\nplot(p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis and Conclusion\nI then fitted both objects to a linear model, with count as thte outcome for both models and weeks_reporting and disease as the predictor respectively.\nBased on the results of the linear model analysis, both models seem fairly reliable with lmfit2 having the edge.\nThe second model has a higher R-squared, suggesting that it explains a larger proportion of variance in the response variable. The F-statistic is greater in this model, indicating a better overall fit.\nThe low p-value for lmfit1 suggests that weeks_reporting may have some significance in predicting the outcome count. The same is especially true for the second model.\nThe lmfit2 model also had a lower residual standard error compared to lmfit1, further suggesting that the second model’s prediction are closer to the actual value on average.\nBased on the following observation, lmfit2 appears to perform as the better model, with a more significant predictor, a higher proportion of explained variance, a higher F-statistic, and a lower residual standard error.\n\n#Fitting the data set to a linear model with 'count' as the outcome and 'weekly_reporting' as the predictor\nlmfit1 &lt;- lm(count ~ weeks_reporting, Weeks_Count)\n\n#Use the summary() command to check over the fit \nsummary(lmfit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = count ~ weeks_reporting, data = Weeks_Count)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -910.6  -761.0  -519.6   -99.6 22533.8 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.
